Here are a few notebooks as I'm learning some data science libraries in Python.

A few lessons learned so far:

1. You need to put ```%matplotlib inline``` with your imports so that plots will render inline.
2. Some datasets to play with can be found here: ```from sklearn import datasets```.
3. Other datasets can be downloaded here: <http://http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/>
